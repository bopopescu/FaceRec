# FaceRec

This project implements a facial detection and recognition software using Deep Learning, more specifically MTCNN networks.
The arhitecture is uding a Inception_Resnet_v1 algorithm for extracting 128D facial metrics.
The software is used in a Timesheet managemenet application.

For running this project the sourcecode is needed and the models from the link below to be pasted in the "models" file.
